# exact-spike-timing
C implementation of the prescient and canonical algorithm introduced by [Morrison et al. 2007](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/neco.2007.19.1.47).

These algorithms allow the time-driven simulation of spiking neural networks with precise spike times, rather than spike times that are constrained to points in the underlying time grid.
